        <h1>Pymaceuticals Data Analysis</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The goal of this project was to evaluate the success of 
           various experimental cancer treatments. For that purpose, analyses
           were performed on a dataset compiling the results of mouse drug 
           trials. These analyses resulted in the following observations:
           <ul>
               <li>Of the 10 different treatments attempted, 
                   only two drugs were successful in reducing tumor 
                   volume - Ramicane and Capomulin. They produced a 
                   22.3% and a 19.5% decrease in tumor volume 
                   respectively.</li>
                <li>For all 10 treatments, the number of metastic sites 
                    increased over time. The smallest amount of growth 
                    was associated with Capomulin and Ramicane.</li>
                <li>Groups treated with Capomulin and Ramicane 
                    treatments had the highest survival rates - above 
                    80%.</li>
                <li>Ketapril appears to be the least effective treatment 
                    with a low survivial rate and an exceedingly high 
                    growth in tumor volume (57%).</li>
           </ul>
        </p>
